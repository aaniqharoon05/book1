# Constitution of the Book Project

| Version | Ratification Date | Last Amended |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0.0 | 2025-12-12 | 2025-12-12 |

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the guiding principles and standards for the "Book" project. The project's goal is to create educational content for beginner to intermediate learners in AI, robotics, and computer science. This constitution ensures that all contributions are clear, accurate, and accessible.

## 2. Governance

This constitution is a living document. Amendments follow this process:
- **Proposal:** Any contributor may propose a change via a pull request.
- **Review:** The proposal must be reviewed and approved by project maintainers.
- **Versioning:** Changes are versioned semantically:
  - **MAJOR:** Incompatible changes (e.g., removing a core principle).
  - **MINOR:** Adding new principles or sections.
  - **PATCH:** Clarifications and typo fixes.

## 3. Principles

### Principle 1: Clarity and Accessibility

- **Rule:** Content MUST be written for a beginner-to-intermediate audience. Explanations must build intuition first before diving into technical details. The target Flesch-Kincaid reading grade is 8-10.
- **Rationale:** To make complex topics in AI, robotics, and computer science approachable for newcomers.

### Principle 2: Structured and Progressive Learning

- **Rule:** Content MUST be presented with step-by-step clarity. Use diagrams, examples, and progressive code samples to build knowledge incrementally.
- **Rationale:** A structured approach helps learners build a strong foundation and connect concepts effectively.

### Principle 3: No Jargon Without Definition

- **Rule:** Technical jargon MUST be defined clearly upon its first use. Avoid assuming prior knowledge.
- **Rationale:** Ensures that readers are not lost due to unfamiliar terminology, promoting a smoother learning experience.

### Principle 4: Factual and Technical Accuracy

- **Rule:** All technical information, claims, and code examples MUST be fact-checked and verified for correctness. Content must be supported by primary sources where applicable.
- **Rationale:** To build trust and provide reliable educational material. The project has zero tolerance for misinformation.

### Principle 5: Authoritative and Ethical Sourcing

- **Rule:** A minimum of 50% of sources MUST be from peer-reviewed papers or authoritative technical documentation. All sources MUST be cited using APA format. The project has a zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism.
- **Rationale:** Upholds academic and ethical standards, ensuring the content is well-researched and gives credit appropriately.

### Principle 6: Executable and Reproducible Code

- **Rule:** All code examples provided MUST be complete, executable, and correct. The project will emphasize reproducibility, ensuring that learners can replicate results.
- **Rationale:** Practical, working code is essential for hands-on learning and reinforcing theoretical concepts.

### Principle 7: Consistency Across Deliverables

- **Rule:** These principles apply to all project deliverables, including the book itself and any associated systems (e.g., a RAG system). Factual correctness and clarity are paramount everywhere.
- **Rationale:** To ensure a consistent and high-quality experience across the entire project ecosystem.
